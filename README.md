A description of the script in the file **run\_analysis.R**, organized
by the 5 steps in the Course Project description.

### Step 0: Import Data Sets from Files

Before we can start with any of the steps, we need to first import the
raw data in the training and test files into R objects. The path names
to the files are constructed in a platform-independent way by using
the *file.path* function, with all data files being stored in the
directory "UCI HAR Dataset" that resides in the same folder as the R
script. 

### Step 1: Merging the Training and Test Data

### Step 2: Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements

### Step 3: Descriptive Activity Names

### Step 4: Adding Descriptive Variable Names

### Step 5: Data Set with Average of each Variable
